For this project we were tasked with creating 6 tables relating to the CSV files in the "data" folder.  The syntax used to accomplish this are located in sql_scripts.  
We then imported the CSVs into Postgres to the corresponding tables. This could be difficult if the primary keys were not set correctly. But once that is confirmed,
and you check the headers box, a simple import handled that. 

In the ERD_project image you can see the foreign keys that were created post table creation, and they should all be connected in a meaningful way. 

In the Outputs folder there are 8 images q1-q8_sql, they correspond to the following questions respectively:
q1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee
q2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986
q3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name
q4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name
q5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B
q6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
q7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
q8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names
