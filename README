For this project we were tasked with creating 6 tables relating to the CSV files in the "data" folder.  The syntax used to accomplish this are located in sql_scripts.  
We then imported the CSVs into Postgres to the corresponding tables. This could be difficult if the primary keys were not set correctly. But once that is confirmed,
and you check the headers box, a simple import handled that. 

In the ERD_project image you can see the foreign keys that were created post table creation, and they should all be connected in a meaningful way. 

I also was able to answer two questions up to this point. The screenshot results are includes in the output folder. I feel those outputs prove I imported the data correctly, otherwise they would not have worked properly.
