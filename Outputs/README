For this project we were tasked with creating 6 tables relating to the CSV files in the "data" folder.  The syntax used to accomplish this are located in sql_scripts.  
We then imported the CSVs into Postgres to the corresponding tables. This could be difficult if the primary keys were not set correctly. But once that is confirmed,
and you check the headers box, a simple import handled that. 

In the ERD_project image you can see the foreign keys that were created post table creation, and they should all be connected in a meaningful way. 

The final part is coming next.
